SEEDi Technical Workflow with Integrated Agriculture Modules
SEEDi is a mobile web-based agrifood decision-support platform that transforms structured
agricultural knowledge into clear, comparable, context-aware insights for farmers, advisors,
policymakers, and SMEs.a guided intelligence system.
Core Design Principle
Instead of many tabs and confusion, SEEDi works through:
4 Clear Workflow Steps
1 Define Context
2 Explore & Compare
3 Analyze & Simulate
4. Generate Action Output
Everything fitsinside these 4 stages.

Sustainable Evidence for Emerging Decisions
 The Problem
Agricultural decision-makers operate in an environment of growing complexity:
Expanding datasets
Thousands of documented innovations
Diverse geographic and socio-economic contexts
Urgent sustainability and inclusion goals
While information is abundant, translating it into clear, context-specific decisions remains
difficult. Stakeholders must manually interpret data, compare innovations, assess readiness,
and evaluate trade-offs — often without structured guidance.
The gap is not information.
The gap is decision clarity.
 The Solution
SEEDi is a context-aware decision navigation platform that transforms structured agricultural
innovation data into ranked, explainable action pathways.
By combining user-defined context with validated innovation metadata,
SEEDi:
• Filters solutions based on geography, priorities, and constraints
• Scores feasibility using readiness and adoption levels
• Highlights trade-offs between impact, risk, and scalability
• Generates structured decision summaries
• Makes reasoning transparent and traceable
SEEDi helps users move from complexity to clarity in a guided, structured flow.
 Who It Is For
SEEDi supports:
▪ Policymakers designing agricultural strategies
▪ Development organizations planning interventions
▪ Impact investors assessing innovation maturity
▪ Researchers conducting gap and systems analysis
▪ Program designers working in LMIC and climate-vulnerable regions
▪ It is especially valuable where decisions must balance:
o Sustainability
o Inclusion
o Scalability
o Resource constraints
 Value Proposition
SEEDi delivers:
✔ Context-driven filtering rather than generic search
✔ Ranked pathways instead of long result lists
✔ Transparent scoring grounded in structured datasets
✔ Clear trade-off visualization
✔ Downloadable, decision-ready briefs
It turns agricultural knowledge into actionable, explainable decision intelligence.
 Core Differentiator
SEEDi integrates:
• Structured innovation repositories
• Contextual user inputs
• Rule-based scoring logic
• Explainable AI summarization
The result is a guided navigation experience that reduces cognitive overload and
supports confident, evidence-based agricultural decision-making.
